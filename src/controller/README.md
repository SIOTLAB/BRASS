## Controller code

This folder contains the source code for running the controller. The controller can be run using the command
```
./contoller.py <controller ip> <port>
```
Controller ip is the IP address of the device that runs the controller process. 
Port will be the port assigned to the controller for switch discovery, and port+1 will be assigned to end host reservation requests
